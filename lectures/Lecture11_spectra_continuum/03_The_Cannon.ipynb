    "\"Figure 5. First-order coefficients and scatter across the sample regions of the spectra from Figure 3, (A) and (B). Top panel: the baseline spectra representing the first coefficient from the set of reference spectra; middle panel: the next three coefficients (${\\theta }_{1}$, ${\\theta }_{2}$, ${\\theta }_{3}$), which correspond to the labels (${T}_{\\mathrm{eff}},\\mathrm{log}\\;g,[\\mathrm{Fe}/{\\rm{H}}]$ ); bottom panel: the scatter of the fit with a tenfold expanded vertical scale. The red, blue, and green areas in the top panel encompass the wavelength regions with the 5% highest (absolute value) coefficients for the $[\\mathrm{Fe}/{\\rm{H}}]$, $\\mathrm{log}\\;g$ and ${T}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ labels, respectively. The ${T}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ coefficient has been multiplied by a factor of 1000 simply to show this coefficient on a similar scale to the other coefficients. This indicates where the flux in these spectrum is particularly sensitive to the labels. Note that the $[\\mathrm{Fe}/{\\rm{H}}]$ label is dominant in the contribution level and from the top panel it is clear that there is significant covariance between the labels and there are only a few regions of $\\mathrm{log}\\;g$ sensitivity. The filled dots in the baseline spectrum in the top penal indicate the wavelengths at which the dependencies on all labels are weak, which we operatively identify as continuum pixels.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are very few regions where the flux is a function of only one of the labels, and pixels are typically co-variant. (that is, the same pixel will have a higher flux at both lower ${T}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and higher $[\\mathrm{Fe}/{\\rm{H}}]$). This simply reflects well-known co-variances between, for example, temperature and $[\\mathrm{Fe}/{\\rm{H}}]$. The strongest $\\mathrm{log}\\;g$ dependence is typically associated with weak lines including the wings of the feature and the $[\\mathrm{Fe}/{\\rm{H}}]$ label, with strong lines, particularly the depth of the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The scatter is small and this indicates that our model is a good representation of the data. However, the scatter is highest where the most information in the spectra are contained. This implies that either our quadratic-in-labels spectral model is still somewhat too restricted, or that the labels of our training data set are imperfect or incomplete (for example, lacking $[\\alpha /\\mathrm{Fe}]$ as a label), or a combination of these effects.\n",
