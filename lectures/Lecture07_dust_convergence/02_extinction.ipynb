    "\n",
    "* Extinction is the absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by dust and gas between an emitting astronomical object and the observer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The effects of extinction were first documented by Berkeley Astronomer Robert Trumpler in 1930.\n",

    " * Consider a hot object (e.g., a star) emitted light with a specific flux $F_{\\lambda, 0}$ that is some distance $d$ away from us.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Along the line of sight there is some dust.  The dust has some (constant) number density $n$ and each dust grain has a cross-section $\\sigma_{\\lambda}$.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " * We can define the quanity optical depth, $\\tau_{\\lambda} = \\int_0^d \\sigma_{\\lambda} n ds$.  $\\tau$ is dimensionless and effectively measures the average number of times a photon scatters as it travels through a medium. \n",
    " \n",
    "  - $\\tau \\gg 1$ is called __optically thick__ which means a photon has a short mean free path (the average distance it travels before scattering). \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - $\\tau \\ll 1$ is called __optically thin__ which means a photon has a long mean free path.\n",

    " * Consider a $F_{\\lambda}$ is the specific flux we receive at Earth from a hot source, moduldated by the light that is scattered out of the line-of-sight by the intervening dust.  This can be expressed mathematically as:\n",
    " \n",
    "    $F_{\\lambda} = F_{\\lambda, 0} e^{-\\tau_{\\lambda}} = F_{\\lambda, 0} e^{- \\int_0^d \\sigma_{\\lambda} n ds} = F_{\\lambda, 0} e^{- \\sigma_{\\lambda} n d}$ \n",
    " \n",
    " where the exponential term comes from solving the equation of radiative transfer.\n",

    "* The ratio of observed to incident flux is then:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $\\frac{F_{\\lambda}}{F_{\\lambda, 0}} = e^{-\\tau_{\\lambda}}$\n",

    "    \n",
    "    $-2.5\\log_{10}(\\frac{F_{\\lambda}}{F_{\\lambda, 0}}) = -2.5\\log_{10}(e^{-\\tau_{\\lambda}}) \\rightarrow$\n",

    "    $m_{\\lambda} \\sim 1.086 \\tau_{\\lambda} = A_{\\lambda}$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* $A_{\\lambda}$ is called __selective absoprtion__.  It is measured in practice by comparing the spectra from two stars of same spectral type, one with no/low extinction.\n",
    " \n",
    "* __Color Excess__ is the measured color of an object minus its intrinsic color:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $E_{\\lambda  1 - \\lambda 2} = (m_{\\lambda  1} -m_{\\lambda 2}) - (m_{\\lambda  1} -m_{\\lambda 2})_0$\n",

    "\n",
    "* In practice, for historical reasons, we often use $A_V$ and $E(B-V)$ (i.e., blue and visual filters)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The relation between selective absoption and color excess is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "    $R_V = \\frac{A_V}{E(B-V)}$\n",
