    "\"Hi AY 128! This class is likely going to be one that you get so much out of. It was definitely one of my peers' and my favorite course at Cal, because we learned so much.  If you are interested in pursuing a graduate degree or going into data science, invest your time in 128 because the skills you learn are highly transferable to many different research projects! I'm now in a PhD program, and I find myself going back to the code I wrote in 128 to use in research/problem sets now.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do want to emphasize that this class is a lot of work! You get what you put in. Do the checkpoints!!! You may think it's only worth a few points so you can skip it, but your future self will thank you because they do add up and it will be so difficult to do the labs right before the deadline. There can be many hiccups along the way such as Gaia going down, so starting early does help so you're not frustrated last minute (this happened many times to our Spring 2020 class). This can't be said enough, but comment your code too. Also the GSIs are an extremely valuable resource—they are so helpful/knowledgeable!\"\n",
