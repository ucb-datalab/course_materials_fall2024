    "These are based on database photometry from the DR2 catalog, but Gaia (like many modern surveys) take many measurements in time (we typically use the average magnitude). At the 1% photometry level most (>95%) of stars are quiescent -- ie. largely unchanging in time. A variable star is a source (sometimes more than one star, in a gravitationally bound system of stars) which varies in brightness in time (by how much is somewhat in the eye of the beholder). "

    "These all exhibit departures from hydrostatic equilibrium.  In Lab 1 we're going to be focused on RR Lyrae and Gaia (see https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...595A.133C/abstract). The prototype for this class is the star ... RR Lyrae ($d$=270 Â± 20 pc), the brightest variable star in the constellation Lyra. Having moved passed the red giant phase, RRLyr stars are helium core burning (horizontal branch).  RRLyr live on the \"instability strip\" of the H-R diagram, where temperature, density, and atmospheric opacities exist in such a delicate balance that small changes lead to large-amplitude periodic fluctuations in the star size. These are \"radial pulsators\". Assuming a fixed temperature ($\\approx 6000$ K), $L \\propto A_{\\rm surf} \\propto R^2$ implies radial changes of order 15% lead to luminosity changes of order 30%."
