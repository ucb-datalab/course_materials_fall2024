    "### Course Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce and motivate a range of analysis techniques and data pipelining\n",
    "- Gain practical, in-depth experience doing inference on real, open-ended modern astronomical challenges\n",
    "- Build reproducible, well-tested, well-documented software & infrastructure\n",
    "- Learn to work with open data and code, and in an open science environment\n",
    "- Hone presentation (speaking & visualization) skills\n",
    "- Develop skills for future in academia, industry, …\n",
    "\n",
    "### Communication \n",
    "\n",
    "* Main communication channel for us is Ed Discussion. Please sign up now if you haven't already (https://edstem.org/us/join/ruZfdd).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Course website will contain relevant links (https://ucb-datalab.github.io/), mostly pointing to the online material in GitHub (https://github.com/ucb-datalab/course_materials_fall2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Labs and checkpoints to be submitted using bCourses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Course Format\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4 credits (grad and undergrad)\n",
    "- Twice weekly 1.5 hour meeting\n",
    "- “Show & tell” progress reports + instructor lecture\n",
    "- 4 labs (numbered 0-3)\n",
    "- Will require a fair amount of dedicated coding time\n",
    "- It WILL fulfill the astro major lab requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lectures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Monday and Wednesday  10:30 am-noon in 131 Campbell\n",
    "\n",
    "* We encourage you to participate during lecture by asking questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Office Hours & Sections\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dan: TBD\n",
    "* Peter/Saahit: TBD\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grading\n",
    "* 10%: Class Participation -- Active engagement in class discussion and lecture, participation during \"show and tell\", Ed Discussion Q&A, office hours; we know you may need to miss lecture (e.g. illness), and therefore there are several ways to get a good participation grade\n",
    "* 65%: Lab Reports/Notebooks -- due before specified class, -10% for each day late, you can collaborate with people in the class, but all work, writeups, notebooks, coding, plots, etc. MUST be your own\n",
    "* 25%: Lab Checkpoints -- each week, graded on completeness, not accuracy (mostly), __2 lowest checkpoint scores will be dropped__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datahub\n",
    "* You can execute your labs locally or using Berkeley's datahub: https://astro.datahub.berkeley.edu.  You will need to use Python. We use 3.11.* here but anything from >3.9 should be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Waitlist\n",
    "* We are at capacity; waitlist students can only be added if some students drop. If you're on the waitlist we strongly recommend that you come to the first lectures and attempt Lab 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Astro background\n",
    "* This is an astronomy class.  We will do our best to give you the base level astronomy knowledge needed for each lab. For those without astro backgrounds, it will take extra time to understand the astronomy.  Ask on Ed Discussion, office hours, etc.  We are happy to help.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding background\n",
    "* This is a coding intensive class. We will use python.  If you're not already comfortable working in python, this may not be the class for you.  We are here to help with coding questions as best we can.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Mangement\n",
    "* This is a time intesnive lab class. It usually doesn't work well to start working on checkpoints, labs, etc. right before they are due.  If you're taking a heavy course load this semester, you may find yourself really crunched for time because this class is time intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answering questions on Ed Discussion\n",
    "* Please don't email us quesitons about your code/checkpoint.  Use <a href=\"https://edstem.org/us/join/ruZfdd\">Ed Discussion</a>.\n",
    "* We do our best to answer questions, but we also not always online.  We may not get to questions before a deadline or as quickly as you would like.  That's part of time management.  We encourage students to answer each other's questions, that's really the best use of Ed Discussion and helps your participation grade."
