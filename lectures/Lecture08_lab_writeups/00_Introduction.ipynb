    " - may not have gotten the pefect K-mode fit on the first attempt, but got a result that was not terrible (e.g., $K$=0, $K$=25)\n",
    " - instead of trying to perfect the K-mode fit, use what you have to move on to the rest of the problems to get to the checkpoint OR you use the data-averaged magnitudes to move forward\n",
    " - then after sketching out a framework for the entire problem (i.e., checkpoint or lab), you go back and iteratively improve your results\n",
